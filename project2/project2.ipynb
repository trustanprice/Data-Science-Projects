    "Hello! For my project I will be finding whether shooting percentages are more important for scoring than non shooting statistics. To find this, I will data scrape https://www.basketball-reference.com/ for data frames on individual NBA athletes, finding the correlations of certain statistics  Since I was little, basketball has been my favorite sport and one of the things that brought me the most joy in life; therefore, it only felt right to incorporate basketball into this project. In addition to shooting splits, I will calculate other statistics to explain why the correlation between shooting percentages and high level is so strong. \n",

    "After I have imported the packages, I will begin to scrape my data. As you will see, I have scraped the stats of NBA teams' complete rosters from the 2018 & 2019 - 2022 & 2023 seasons. From these dataframes, I plan to calculate and analyze statistics, such as confidence intervals, correlations, and linear regression models, that will bring me closer to answering my experiment question."

    "In the NBA, 3 point shooting has almost become the most important facet of the game; however, there is no denying the importance of being able to get the ball close to the hoop and finishing around the rim. Therefore, I will be finding the correlation between an player having elite 3 point shooting and points per game compared to the correlation of elite inside/ mid-range scoring and points per game. This will help us draw a conclusion as to what is more important for high level scoring. To do this, I will first need to clean my data set by adding and deleting certain columns that will give me a dataset with only statistics that will help me towards my conclusion."

    "As seen here, suprisingly enough, the correlation between 3P% and points per game much lower than expected. I had predicted that the correlation between a good 3P% and PPG would be higher than 0.5 to almost 0.75, although this would make sense because there are players in this dataset who do not shoot even a three per game, lowing the correlation. Another factor could be that the players who dont score many points in NBA games tend to take higher percentage shots because they are not forced to make shots off the dribble like players who score 20+ ppg."

    "Now this is truly exciting to look at because after we have isolated the data we see the 100% shooters, who were outliers, fade away. Now we are able to see the true residuals of 2P% and 3P% to PPG. Although this alone was exciting, I am now intrigued and want to find if there are other non-shooting statistics that relate to high level scoring. First, let us see the correlation between a complete FG% and PPG. We should expect to finally see a postive correlation as this percentage will be tracked using enough players and the correct league conditions."

    "Now let us find the correlation between some non-offensive stats to prove or disprove our claim that 3P% and 2P% will have the highest correlations with ppg. We will now create a dataframe that ensures all players found will have played in at least 70% of games that season, then we will find and analyze the corelations between ppg and non shooting stats. I wonder if it is possible for there to be a better correlation, negative or positive, with non shooting statistics than direct shooting statistics such as 2P%, FG%, and 3P%. To find out if this is true, we will now plot linear regression graphs for multiple non shooting statistics and analyze their correlations to PPG."

    "I have played and watched basketball for as long as I have been able to walk, yet did it ever cross my mind that steals, turnover, and assists would have a higher correlation with points per game than actual shooting percentages. This has made me realize how well professional star players and role players understand their job on the floor. To explain, role players normally score less points than star players, but will make up for it on the defensive end. In the same light, star players tend to play lighter defense because they carry such a heavy weight on the offensive end. I always knew this was the case; however, I would have never guessed to this degree. We have caculated over a 0.75 correlation between turnovers and ppg. This means that ppg has a higher strength with turnovers than field goal percentage.\n",
