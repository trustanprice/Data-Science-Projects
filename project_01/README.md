# Project Title

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation. The notebook provides reproducible steps for analyzing the dataset, applying statistical/machine learning methods, and interpreting results.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Insert source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, class dataset]  
- **Size**: [Number of rows, columns]  
- **Features**: [Key features/variables used]  
- **Target Variable**: [What the model is predicting]

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning and handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Normalization or standardization  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Visualizations (histograms, correlation heatmaps, boxplots)  
   - Identification of outliers and trends  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Algorithms applied: [e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, Neural Networks]  
   - Hyperparameter tuning methods  
   - Train/test or cross-validation strategy  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: [e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, RMSE, AUC]  
   - Best-performing model summary  

## Results
- Key insights: [Highlight findings from analysis or modeling]  
- Best model performance: [Accuracy/score achieved]  
- Observations: [Patterns, relationships, or important variables discovered]  

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebook_name.ipynb
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.
